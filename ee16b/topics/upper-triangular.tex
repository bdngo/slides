\section{Upper Triangularization}


\begin{frame}{Upper Triangularization}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item
Recall that not all square matrices are diagonalizable
            \begin{itemize}
        \item
           An \(n \times n\) matrix is diagonalizable iff has \(n\) linearly independent eigenvectors
            \end{itemize}
        \item
However, all square matrices can be brought into upper triangular form
        \item
I’ll walk through the proof from the notes
        \item
(But I’m not sure how useful this will be / how they would ask questions about this on the test)
        \item
(So if people want to I can instead start taking questions on SVD, time- and frequency-domain analysis of RLC circuits, and phasors)
    \end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{Upper Triangularization Proof}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What are we trying to prove?
            \begin{itemize}
                \item
                    Remember that if \(M\) is diagonalizable, this means that there exists a matrix \(P\) such that \(PMP^{-1}\) was diagonal
                \item In our case, we want to prove that for any square matrix \(A\), there exists a matrix \(T\) such that \(TAT^{-1}\) is upper triangular
            \end{itemize}
        \item We will proceed by induction
        \item First prove a base case (a \(1 \times 1\) matrix must be upper triangular)
        \item  Prove that if there exists such a matrix \(T_0\) for a \(k \times k\) matrix, then there exists the matrix \(T\) for a size \((k+1) \times (k+1)\) matrix
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Clearly a \(1 \times 1\) matrix is upper triangular
        \item 
            First we choose one arbitrary eigenvalue / eigenvector pair, choose an orthonormal basis for \(\mathbb R^n\) (with Gram-Schmidt), then define \(V\) formed with those vectors.

    We can upper triangularize \((k+1) \times (k+1)\) matrices if we assume that \(k \times k\) matrices can be upper triangularized.

    To show this, let \(A\) be an arbitrary \((k+1) \times (k + 1)\) matrix and let \(\lambda, \vec v\) by an eigenvalue/vector pair: \(A \vec v = \lambda \vec v\).
    Normalize \(\vec v\) so that \(\lVert \vec v \rVert = 1\) and choose \(k\) other vectors \(\vec v_1, \ldots, \vec v_k \in \mathbb R^{k+1}\) such that \(\{\vec v, \vec v_1, \ldots, \vec v_k\}\) is an orthonormal basis for \(\mathbb R^{k+1}\). Then the \((k+1) \times (k+1)\) matrix \(V = \begin{bmatrix} \vec v & \vec v_1 & \cdots  &\vec v_k \end{bmatrix}\) is orthogonal, \emph{i.e.} 
        \( V^{-1} = V^T
        \).
